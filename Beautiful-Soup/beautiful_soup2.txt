The 13  Best Bitcoin Gambling Sites 
   
 3. Is Stake.com Legit?  10.0 /10 
 Yes, Stake.com is one of the most legit casinos today to have a reliable gambling experience online and is by no means a scam. Plus most of the Stake games are provably fair to ensure random outcomes. 
 But let's take a look at some of the key features that make Stake.com a legit and safe option for online gambling, so you can judge for yourself. 
 Stake.com License(s) 
 Stake casino holds an official Curaçao eGaming License, which is the standard amongst gambling sites that specialize in cryptocurrency gaming, like Stake.com.  
 Although there is theoretically better licensing available in the online gambling industry, no crypto gambling site has been granted more reputable licensing because cryptocurrency is still too new for gambling regulators. 
  
 Stake.com Safety 
 According to my research, Stake.com has adequate overall safety and security, with no reported issues to date. 
 More importantly, Stake crypto casino offers the  2FA  feature to protect your account.  
 Although 2FA is a standard feature in the cryptocurrency industry, it’s not yet the case in the crypto gambling industry. 
 Stake casino is a verified member of the  Crypto Gambling Foundation . This guarantees that all the provably games on the platform (Stake originals) are provably fair. 
 Bets can be verified on the platform or through third-party websites with an open-source verification procedure. 
  
 Reputation of owners 
 Stake.com was developed by the team behind Primedice, one of the oldest and most popular dice gambling sites, founded in 2013. 
 The owners are well-known and have a great reputation. 
  
 Complaints received 
 At the time of writing, the Stake.com TrustPilot page has a 4.1 reputation, which is a great rating for a crypto casino.  
 In addition, the majority of the 13% 1-star reviews are addressed by Stake.com’s staff, which is a sign they care about user satisfaction. 
 Stake gambling also has an excellent reputation on forums like BitcoinTalk where players heavily recommend the website to other players. 
   
 4. Prohibited Countries
 
 
   Change country

  United States

  North Korea 
  Serbia 
  Aland Islands 
  Australia 
  Poland 
  Turkey 
  France 
 
 
 
 See All Prohibited Countries 
 
 
 
 Furthermore, NetEnt, one of the Stake game providers, has an additional list of restrictions related to the distribution of its games in certain jurisdictions. 
 
5. Stake Casino Features  10.0 /10 
 Stake.com is an online crypto casino that was founded in 2017. The site operates under an official Curaçao eGaming License. 
 Despite being relatively new, Stake online casino has already managed to build a steady and faithful user base. 
 After you have set-up your account, you can head to your preferred category of Stake games.  
 Stake casino has several categories, including Slots, Live Casino, Game Shows, Jackpot Slots, Feature Buy-in, Table Games, Virtual Games, Blackjack, Baccarat, and Roulette. 
  
 Stake online casino review - Games Categories 
On an individual level, each category has an abundance of titles and games from various providers. Here are the numbers of offerings featured on the Stake crypto casino: 
 
 Slots (811 games) 
 
 
 Live Casino (20 games) 
 
 
 Game Shows (7 games) 
 
 
 Jackpot Slots (41 games) 
 
 
 Feature Buy-in (58 games) 
 
 
 Table Games (41 games) 
 
 
 Virtual Games (9 games) 
 
 
 Blackjack (4 games) 
 
 
 Baccarat (6 games) 
 
 
 Roulette (8 games) 
 
 The best thing is, Stake.com also has 16 of its own original games, all of which are provably fair. 
 These Stake games include Dice, Keno, Limbo, Plinko, Mines, Hilo, Crash, Scarab Spin, Diamonds, Blue Samurai, Wheel, Slide, Blackjack, Video Poker, Roulette, and Baccarat. 
  
 Stake games review - Stake Originals (exclusive games) 
This takes the total to over 1,000 Stake games by more than 25 providers that you can play. 
 It is worth noting that not only are there many games you can play, but their graphics also are pretty good.  
 Collectively, this contributes to a wonderful gaming experience. 
 The abundance of offerings means even if you are looking for game titles outside the most popular ones, Stake.com will not disappoint you. 
 All-in-all, the casino supports one of the richest libraries of games in the online gambling industry. 
   
 6. Stake Betting Features  9.0 /10 
 
Those interested in sports betting would love to hear that Stake.com offers one of the most extensive portfolios of sports events. 
 Stake’s betting offerings are divided into more than 35 categories. 
 Those include anything from traditional and esports to exotic sports and even political events and entertainment. 
 The most popular sports betting offers include: American football, baseball, boxing, Formula 1, golf, tennis, volleyball, MMA, racing, and more. 
 The esports betting feature Counter-Strike, Dota 2, League of Legends, StarCraft, and various other electronic leagues. 
 There are also sports that you might have never heard of like Gaelic Football, Gaelic Hurling, and Floorball. Yup, those are real sports! 
 At Stake.com you can also bet on the outcome of presidential elections around the world, sports personalities of the year, and many other unconventional bets. 
  
 Stake betting review - Sportsbook Interface 
 
For the majority of the events, there are over 100 outcomes you can bet on, which makes Stake.com’s sportsbook truly robust. 
 The diversity of the site’s betting section is not only one of the site’s key distinguishing factors but is also among the best in the industry. 
 The main downside of Stake betting is that the odds on most events are below the industry’s average. 
   
 7. Stake Poker Features 
 Unfortunately, there is no poker option on the Stake online casino apart from video poker. But if anything changes, we’ll be sure to review it here! 
   
 8. Stake Gambling Experience  9.0 /10 
 Registering before you can start with the Stake gambling is extremely easy. All you need is a name, password, and email address. 
 In some aspects like rich features and simplistic site design, Stake.com offers a great player experience. 
 However, in others, like providing enough information to its user base, it falls short. 
 Let’s get in detail to see what I am talking about. 
   
 Platform Features and Functionalities 
 Stake gambling experience is very fluid and quick. There is no lag or excessive waiting time for games to load. 
 However, it is worth noting that, similar to most casino websites, the offerings on Stake.com also run on Adobe Flash. 
 The UX is intuitive, and you can access each section of the site in no more than three clicks. 
  
 Stake gambling review - User Friendly Search Functionality 
This means even the crypto gambling newcomer won’t have any problem navigating through Stake casino. 
 If you don’t find what you are looking for, you can use the search bar at the top. 
 It will help you get to everything you need, and more importantly – filter the results. 
 Let’s take sports events, for example.  
 There might be hundreds of gambling events on busy days, and finding your preferred ones can be time-consuming. 
 Instead of browsing within the category, you can simply type a keyword in the search bar, and it will display the event. 
 Stake gambling on mobile version works pretty well too. 
 However, it is worth noting that, similar to most online casinos, Stake.com doesn’t have a mobile app. 
 All-in-all, the site’s features and functionalities are great and easily surpass the industry average. Yet, it isn’t flawless. 
 Like any online gambling platform, Stake casino is prone to experiencing some issues now and then. However, most of the time, these are minor and just cosmetic. 
 To spot and solve these issues, Stake.com relies significantly on its users’ feedback. All reported issues, no matter how small they are, get resolved. 
 If you want to keep an eye on the platform improvements, and the issues it experiences over time, make sure to check its  ChangeFeed log , where it reports all bug fixes. 
  Stake casino review - ChangeFeed 
   
 Design and appearance 
 Stake.com tries to keep things simple. There are no excessive animations, pop-ups, promotional banners, or other flashy stuff that may affect your gambling experience. 
 The platform's dark theme makes it easy on the eyes, which helps gamblers who use to spend consecutive hours on online casinos. 
 The games' graphics are pretty standard and nothing too spectacular. This isn't necessarily a disadvantage, and many users prefer it that way. 
 It is worth noting that, although plain and simple, Stake.com is not another dull crypto casino site. Its design offers just what you need for a great gambling experience, and nothing more. 
  
 Informational Resources 
 Most online casinos' notable problem is the lack of sufficient information on their websites. 
 For example, many lack detail about their history, founders’ background, payout details, limits, restrictions, fees, and other crucial information.  
 With Stake.com, things aren't much different. It seems like the platform doesn't even bother covering the relevant information. 
 Several sections of the site provide details, including the Privacy Policy, Terms, and Provably Fair pages, but that information is more on the legal side of things. 
 There is also a blog that features all the latest news and updates about the Stake crypto casino.  
 It also answers popular questions and provides users with ideas on how to get the most out of the platform. 
 Also, there is a helpful forum that you can browse through when you get stuck. 
  
 Stake casino review - Active Forum 
The forum is buzzing with life, which is an excellent sign for the community. On average, the forum counts between 500 and 800 users online per day. 
 A new question/comment is posted every few minutes, making the forum a great place to get in touch with someone from the Stake casino or engage with a random user. 
 Stake.com’s Telegram channel has over 7k members, and the community there is also very active. 
 The major downside is that there isn’t a dedicated FAQ section, which may confuse some users in their search for basic information. 
 For example, it is hard to find the deposit and withdrawal requirements, fees, and payout times. 
 The easiest thing to do is to contact the support line and wait for some guidance. 
 Gambling Aware Program 
 A good thing I should mention here is that Stake online casino offers help to those for whom gambling turns into a real addiction. 
 If you feel things are getting out of hand with Stake gambling, you can take advantage of the platform’s responsible gaming tools. 
 For example, you can set deposit limits and self-exclusion, making sure you aren't gambling with more than you can afford to lose, or just stay away from the site for a while. 
 You can also reach out for help through the Gamble Aware link in the footer of Stake.com. 
  
 9. Welcome Bonus 
 Well, finally, you reached the point where Stake casino falls somehow behind its competitors. 
 The fact that the casino doesn’t offer a welcome bonus is quite disappointing for newcomers. 
 That said, the good thing about a lack of welcome bonuses is that Stake.com won’t hold back your withdrawals. No need to meet a threshold or limit to take your winnings out. 
 Stake casino also compensates for the lack of welcome bonus by offering awesome and frequent rewards to their players via their promotions. 
 And of course, as I mentioned, we negotiated an exclusive benefit: 15% rakeback on your account, forever. 
 Stake.com Promo Code 
 You should use the  promo code "MANIAKS"  when registering your account. By using this bonus code, you will get 15% rakeback on your account instantly, forever. 
 If you forgot to enter the promo code, no worry! If you just signed up, go to your account, then "Settings", then "Offers", and then enter the code in the section "Welcome Offer". 
 This will apply the 15% rakeback to your account going forward. 
 Use the code "MANIAKS" on Stake.com for 15% Lifetime Rakeback Note : We found codes online offering up to 50% rakeback. We have been many times confirmed by Stake representatives that 15% is the best offer available on the market. By using these Stake.com bonus codes, you take the risk to not get any rakeback added to your account. If you are note sure what benefits you are currently getting, contact live chat support. 
   
 10. Promotions  10.0 /10 
 
It is clear that Stake.com’s team considers promotional programs as a key pillar of its business development strategy. 
 The platform offers 15 different promotions at the time of my review. 
 The main one is the chance to win a Lamborghini Huracan Evo, which, according to the platform, is worth no less than $212,266 USD. 
 In addition, there are also 50 x $1,000 prizes. 
  
 Stake.com review - Top Promotions 
Stake casino also offers sports live betting promotions, money-back programs, game-specific rewards, special promotions for particular user groups (a $5,000 Diwali Giveaway), Telegram challenges, and more. 
 While some promotions are recurring, others are limited-time offers. That is why, to avoid missing out, you should keep an eye on the "Promotions" page. 
 You can find the whole list of Stake.com's promotions and their terms  here . 
 The fact the terms and conditions of promotions are minimal is one of the reasons I love Stake online casino. No ‘impossible-to-win’ promotions on the site. 
 I can say that the promotions are a very diversified, attractive, and, a very thoughtful way to keep Stake.com's community engaged. 
 It is also worth noting that the site also has a VIP program. According to the official description, it is designed to suit different types of players. 
 The program's goal is to ensure you will receive the most in cumulative bonuses for every dollar wagered on the gambling platform. 
 The program is composed of different tiers, each of which unlocks different types of bonuses. 
 Stake.com's team claims that its VIP program is unrivaled.  
  Stake casino review - VIP Benefits Overview 
However, to be able to taste the maximum experience, they say you should reach the highest level of the program. 
 Among Stake casino's perks are a dedicated VIP host (think of it as a personal virtual assistant), flexible bonuses like receiving the newest iPhone instead of your weekly top-up (not sure why anyone would want that, but still…), and more. 
 There are also weekly and monthly bonuses, level-up bonuses, Rakeback rewards, and more. 
 The only way to become a part of the VIP program is to receive an invite. 
 The tricky part is that, according to Stake.com, you can get an invite based on your activity on the platform. 
 Alternatively, it means the more bets you place, the bigger your chance to be invited gets. 
 You can find the complete terms of Stake.com’s VIP program  here . 
   
 11. Customer Service  10.0 /10 
 
 Email :  [email protected]   
 Phone Number : Not available 
 Customer service usually is the make-it-or-break-it point with online casinos, and it should be among the top deciding factors when choosing the right platform for you. 
 Stake.com's online support can be described with just a single word: amazing. 
 The main communication channel is the 24/7 Live Chat feature on the site. According to the information there, the average response time is five minutes. 
 When I got in touch with the support, I was surprised as I received an answer in under a minute. 
 It seemed like the guy was just waiting for me to drop a message! 
 This really is something rarely seen with online casino support teams. 
 Most importantly, the support was great; the agent was well-trained and brought to my attention the information I needed to enhance my experience. 
 Stake.com can also be reached through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. 
 The only downside is there is no telephone line, which, in all fairness, isn’t too much of a problem, considering how responsive the support team is in the live chat. 
 Overall, support at Stake casino is very helpful in finding you a detailed answer and getting back to you quickly. They’ll send you screenshots and URLs to back up their responses and explain things to you. 
  
 12. Payments  8.0 /10 
 Stake.com is a crypto-only casino and sportsbook service provider. 
 This means you can’t use traditional payment options. 
  
 Stake review - Deposit Methods 
 However, Stake.com recently launched a functionality that allows you to buy crypto with fiat (USD and EUR) directly on the platform. 
 The rates are a bit higher than on traditional exchanges, which doesn’t make it the most cost-efficient solution. 
   Stake.com review - Buy Crypto With Fiat 
This means the best thing to do before getting started with the Stake crypto casino is still to go and buy some of the supported crypto assets elsewhere and transfer them to the platform. 
  
 Deposits 
 The deposit methods available on Stake are: 
 
 Cryptocurrencies 
 BTC 
 ETH 
 LTC 
 DOGE 
 BCH 
 XRP 
 TRX 
 EOS 
 
 If you don’t see your preferred cryptocurrency here, don’t worry. 
 Due to an integration with the Coinswitch API, Stake.com now allows users to deposit using over 130+ cryptocurrencies. 
 The exchange happens instantaneously and directly on site. All the user has to do is select the assets he wants to exchange from a drop-down list. 
 This brings significant flexibility and makes the Stake casino accessible by every crypto enthusiast out there. 
  
 Withdrawals 
 The withdrawal methods available on Stake are: 
 
 Cryptocurrencies 
 BTC 
 DOGE 
 ETH 
 LTC 
 BCH 
 XRP 
 TRX 
 EOS 
 
 Because of being a crypto-only casino, users can withdraw funds from Stake online casino only to crypto wallets. 
 This means you won’t be able to cash out immediately and would have to go to an exchange or a secondary market to exchange your crypto for  fiat  (if that is your end goal). 
 Unfortunately, Stake.com does not offer the ability to deposit, withdraw and play with  stablecoins . 
  
 Maximum Payouts 
 Stake online casino doesn’t impose any maximum payout limits. However, there are minimum requirements that you should adhere to. 
 Besides, each payout is charged a fee. Here are all the payout options, the minimum amounts, and the imposed fees: 
   
 Payout Option 
 Minimum Amount 
 Fee 
 Bitcoin 
 0.002 BTC 
 0.0002 BTC 
 Bitcoin Cash 
 0.05 BCH 
 0.00001 BCH 
 Ethereum 
 0.1 ETH 
 0.0027 ETH 
 Litecoin 
 0.25 LTC 
 0.0005 LTC 
 Ripple 
 50 XRP 
 0.0001 XRP 
 TRON 
 750 TRX 
 1 TRX 
 EOS 
 4 EOS 
 0.1 EOS 
 DOGE 
 5000 DOGE 
 1.5 DOGE 
 
Nobody likes paying fees, but in this case, I should say the rates at Stake casino aren’t over-the-top. 
 The fact that there are no maximum payouts means you can withdraw all funds even if you hit the jackpot. 
 In many other competing online casinos, this isn’t possible, which often increases the anxiety levels of gamblers who want to take out all their rewards at once and avoid storing them on the platform. 
  
 Payout Speed 
 Deposits and withdrawals on the Stake crypto casino are instant, with no delays. 
 Of course, you will have to wait the usual confirmation time associated with the different blockchains, but all-in-all, it shouldn’t take over a couple of hours. 
 In most cases, the pending time won’t exceed the hour mark. However, if it takes too long (over 24 hours), make sure to contact Stake.com’s support.
