Yes, Stake.com is one of the most legit casinos today to have a reliable
gambling experience online and is by no means a scam. Plus most of the Stake
games are provably fair to ensure random outcomes.
But let's take a look at some of the key features that make Stake.com a legit
and safe option for online gambling, so you can judge for yourself.
******** SSttaakkee..ccoomm LLiicceennssee((ss)) ********
Stake casino holds an official CuraÃ§ao eGaming License, which is the standard
amongst gambling sites that specialize in cryptocurrency gaming, like
Stake.com.
Although there is theoretically better licensing available in the online
gambling industry, no crypto gambling site has been granted more reputable
licensing because cryptocurrency is still too new for gambling regulators.
******** SSttaakkee..ccoomm SSaaffeettyy ********
According to my research, Stake.com has adequate overall safety and security,
with no reported issues to date.
More importantly, Stake crypto casino offers the 2FA feature to protect your
account.
Although 2FA is a standard feature in the cryptocurrency industry, itâs not
yet the case in the crypto gambling industry.
Stake casino is a verified member of the _C_r_y_p_t_o_ _G_a_m_b_l_i_n_g_ _F_o_u_n_d_a_t_i_o_n. This
guarantees that all the provably games on the platform (Stake originals) are
provably fair.
Bets can be verified on the platform or through third-party websites with an
open-source verification procedure.

At the time of writing, the Stake.com TrustPilot page has a 4.1 reputation,
which is a great rating for a crypto casino.
In addition, the majority of the 13% 1-star reviews are addressed by
Stake.comâs staff, which is a sign they care about user satisfaction.
Stake gambling also has an excellent reputation on forums like BitcoinTalk
where players heavily recommend the website to other players.

Stake.com is an online crypto casino that was founded in 2017. The site
operates under an official CuraÃ§ao eGaming License.
Despite being relatively new, Stake online casino has already managed to build
a steady and faithful user base.

Stake games.
Stake casino has several categories, including Slots, Live Casino, Game Shows,
Jackpot Slots, Feature Buy-in, Table Games, Virtual Games, Blackjack, Baccarat,
and Roulette.

On an individual level, each category has an abundance of titles and games from
various providers. Here are the numbers of offerings featured on the Stake

Spin, Diamonds, Blue Samurai, Wheel, Slide, Blackjack, Video Poker, Roulette,

This takes the total to over 1,000 Stake games by more than 25 providers that
you can play.
It is worth noting that not only are there many games you can play, but their
graphics also are pretty good.
Collectively, this contributes to a wonderful gaming experience.
The abundance of offerings means even if you are looking for game titles
outside the most popular ones, Stake.com will not disappoint you.
All-in-all, the casino supports one of the richest libraries of games in the
online gambling industry.

Those interested in sports betting would love to hear that Stake.com offers one
of the most extensive portfolios of sports events.
Stakeâs betting offerings are divided into more than 35 categories.
Those include anything from traditional and esports to exotic sports and even
political events and entertainment.
The most popular sports betting offers include: American football, baseball,
boxing, Formula 1, golf, tennis, volleyball, MMA, racing, and more.
The esports betting feature Counter-Strike, Dota 2, League of Legends,
StarCraft, and various other electronic leagues.
There are also sports that you might have never heard of like Gaelic Football,
Gaelic Hurling, and Floorball. Yup, those are real sports!
At Stake.com you can also bet on the outcome of presidential elections around
the world, sports personalities of the year, and many other unconventional
bets.

For the majority of the events, there are over 100 outcomes you can bet on,
which makes Stake.comâs sportsbook truly robust.
The diversity of the siteâs betting section is not only one of the siteâs
key distinguishing factors but is also among the best in the industry.
The main downside of Stake betting is that the odds on most events are below
the industryâs average.

video poker. But if anything changes, weâll be sure to review it here!

Registering before you can start with the Stake gambling is extremely easy. All
you need is a name, password, and email address.
In some aspects like rich features and simplistic site design, Stake.com offers
a great player experience.
However, in others, like providing enough information to its user base, it
falls short.
Letâs get in detail to see what I am talking about.

Stake gambling experience is very fluid and quick. There is no lag or excessive
waiting time for games to load.
However, it is worth noting that, similar to most casino websites, the
offerings on Stake.com also run on Adobe Flash.
The UX is intuitive, and you can access each section of the site in no more
than three clicks.

This means even the crypto gambling newcomer wonât have any problem
navigating through Stake casino.
If you donât find what you are looking for, you can use the search bar at the
top.
It will help you get to everything you need, and more importantly â filter
the results.
Letâs take sports events, for example.
There might be hundreds of gambling events on busy days, and finding your
preferred ones can be time-consuming.
Instead of browsing within the category, you can simply type a keyword in the
search bar, and it will display the event.
Stake gambling on mobile version works pretty well too.
However, it is worth noting that, similar to most online casinos, Stake.com
doesnât have a mobile app.
All-in-all, the siteâs features and functionalities are great and easily
surpass the industry average. Yet, it isnât flawless.
Like any online gambling platform, Stake casino is prone to experiencing some
issues now and then. However, most of the time, these are minor and just
cosmetic.
To spot and solve these issues, Stake.com relies significantly on its usersâ
feedback. All reported issues, no matter how small they are, get resolved.
If you want to keep an eye on the platform improvements, and the issues it
experiences over time, make sure to check its _C_h_a_n_g_e_F_e_e_d_ _l_o_g, where it reports
all bug fixes.

Stake.com tries to keep things simple. There are no excessive animations, pop-
ups, promotional banners, or other flashy stuff that may affect your gambling
experience.
The platform's dark theme makes it easy on the eyes, which helps gamblers who
use to spend consecutive hours on online casinos.
The games' graphics are pretty standard and nothing too spectacular. This isn't
necessarily a disadvantage, and many users prefer it that way.
It is worth noting that, although plain and simple, Stake.com is not another
dull crypto casino site. Its design offers just what you need for a great
gambling experience, and nothing more.

Most online casinos' notable problem is the lack of sufficient information on
their websites.
For example, many lack detail about their history, foundersâ background,
payout details, limits, restrictions, fees, and other crucial information.
With Stake.com, things aren't much different. It seems like the platform
doesn't even bother covering the relevant information.
Several sections of the site provide details, including the Privacy Policy,
Terms, and Provably Fair pages, but that information is more on the legal side
of things.
There is also a blog that features all the latest news and updates about the
Stake crypto casino.
It also answers popular questions and provides users with ideas on how to get
the most out of the platform.
Also, there is a helpful forum that you can browse through when you get stuck.

The forum is buzzing with life, which is an excellent sign for the community.
On average, the forum counts between 500 and 800 users online per day.
A new question/comment is posted every few minutes, making the forum a great
place to get in touch with someone from the Stake casino or engage with a
random user.
Stake.comâs Telegram channel has over 7k members, and the community there is
also very active.
The major downside is that there isnât a dedicated FAQ section, which may
confuse some users in their search for basic information.
For example, it is hard to find the deposit and withdrawal requirements, fees,
and payout times.
The easiest thing to do is to contact the support line and wait for some
guidance.

A good thing I should mention here is that Stake online casino offers help to
those for whom gambling turns into a real addiction.
If you feel things are getting out of hand with Stake gambling, you can take
advantage of the platformâs responsible gaming tools.
For example, you can set deposit limits and self-exclusion, making sure you
aren't gambling with more than you can afford to lose, or just stay away from
the site for a while.
You can also reach out for help through the Gamble Aware link in the footer of
Stake.com.

Well, finally, you reached the point where Stake casino falls somehow behind
its competitors.
The fact that the casino doesnât offer a welcome bonus is quite disappointing
for newcomers.
That said, the good thing about a lack of welcome bonuses is that Stake.com
wonât hold back your withdrawals. No need to meet a threshold or limit to
take your winnings out.
Stake casino also compensates for the lack of welcome bonus by offering awesome
and frequent rewards to their players via their promotions.
And of course, as I mentioned, we negotiated an exclusive benefit: 15% rakeback
on your account, forever.
******** SSttaakkee..ccoomm PPrroommoo CCooddee ********
You should use the pprroommoo ccooddee ""MMAANNIIAAKKSS"" when registering your account. By using
this bonus code, you will get 15% rakeback on your account instantly, forever.
If you forgot to enter the promo code, no worry! If you just signed up, go to
your account, then "Settings", then "Offers", and then enter the code in the
section "Welcome Offer".
This will apply the 15% rakeback to your account going forward.

It is clear that Stake.comâs team considers promotional programs as a key
pillar of its business development strategy.
The platform offers 15 different promotions at the time of my review.
The main one is the chance to win a Lamborghini Huracan Evo, which, according
to the platform, is worth no less than $212,266 USD.
In addition, there are also 50 x $1,000 prizes.
[stake.com promotions]

Stake casino also offers sports live betting promotions, money-back programs,
game-specific rewards, special promotions for particular user groups (a $5,000
Diwali Giveaway), Telegram challenges, and more.
While some promotions are recurring, others are limited-time offers. That is
why, to avoid missing out, you should keep an eye on the "Promotions" page.
You can find the whole list of Stake.com's promotions and their terms _h_e_r_e.
The fact the terms and conditions of promotions are minimal is one of the
reasons I love Stake online casino. No âimpossible-to-winâ promotions on
the site.
I can say that the promotions are a very diversified, attractive, and, a very
thoughtful way to keep Stake.com's community engaged.
It is also worth noting that the site also has a VIP program. According to the
official description, it is designed to suit different types of players.
The program's goal is to ensure you will receive the most in cumulative bonuses
for every dollar wagered on the gambling platform.
The program is composed of different tiers, each of which unlocks different
types of bonuses.
Stake.com's team claims that its VIP program is unrivaled.

However, to be able to taste the maximum experience, they say you should reach
the highest level of the program.
Among Stake casino's perks are a dedicated VIP host (think of it as a personal
virtual assistant), flexible bonuses like receiving the newest iPhone instead
of your weekly top-up (not sure why anyone would want that, but stillâ¦), and
more.
There are also weekly and monthly bonuses, level-up bonuses, Rakeback rewards,
and more.
The only way to become a part of the VIP program is to receive an invite.
The tricky part is that, according to Stake.com, you can get an invite based on
your activity on the platform.
Alternatively, it means the more bets you place, the bigger your chance to be
invited gets.
You can find the complete terms of Stake.comâs VIP program _h_e_r_e.

Customer service usually is the make-it-or-break-it point with online casinos,
and it should be among the top deciding factors when choosing the right
platform for you.
Stake.com's online support can be described with just a single word: amazing.
The main communication channel is the 24/7 Live Chat feature on the site.
According to the information there, the average response time is five minutes.
When I got in touch with the support, I was surprised as I received an answer
in under a minute.
It seemed like the guy was just waiting for me to drop a message!
This really is something rarely seen with online casino support teams.
Most importantly, the support was great; the agent was well-trained and brought
to my attention the information I needed to enhance my experience.
Stake.com can also be reached through Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.
The only downside is there is no telephone line, which, in all fairness,
isnât too much of a problem, considering how responsive the support team is
in the live chat.
Overall, support at Stake casino is very helpful in finding you a detailed
answer and getting back to you quickly. Theyâll send you screenshots and URLs
to back up their responses and explain things to you.

Stake.com is a crypto-only casino and sportsbook service provider.
This means you canât use traditional payment options.

However, Stake.com recently launched a functionality that allows you to buy
crypto with fiat (USD and EUR) directly on the platform.
The rates are a bit higher than on traditional exchanges, which doesnât make
it the most cost-efficient solution.

This means the best thing to do before getting started with the Stake crypto
casino is still to go and buy some of the supported crypto assets elsewhere and
transfer them to the platform.

If you donât see your preferred cryptocurrency here, donât worry.
Due to an integration with the Coinswitch API, Stake.com now allows users to
deposit using over 130+ cryptocurrencies.
The exchange happens instantaneously and directly on site. All the user has to
do is select the assets he wants to exchange from a drop-down list.
This brings significant flexibility and makes the Stake casino accessible by
every crypto enthusiast out there.

Because of being a crypto-only casino, users can withdraw funds from Stake
online casino only to crypto wallets.
This means you wonât be able to cash out immediately and would have to go to
an exchange or a secondary market to exchange your crypto for _f_i_a_t (if that is
your end goal).
Unfortunately, Stake.com does not offer the ability to deposit, withdraw and
play with stablecoins.

Stake online casino doesnât impose any maximum payout limits. However, there
are minimum requirements that you should adhere to.
Besides, each payout is charged a fee. Here are all the payout options, the
minimum amounts, and the imposed fees:

Nobody likes paying fees, but in this case, I should say the rates at Stake
casino arenât over-the-top.
The fact that there are no maximum payouts means you can withdraw all funds
even if you hit the jackpot.
In many other competing online casinos, this isnât possible, which often
increases the anxiety levels of gamblers who want to take out all their rewards
at once and avoid storing them on the platform.
******** PPaayyoouutt SSppeeeedd ********
Deposits and withdrawals on the Stake crypto casino are instant, with no
delays.
Of course, you will have to wait the usual confirmation time associated with
the different blockchains, but all-in-all, it shouldnât take over a couple of
hours.
In most cases, the pending time wonât exceed the hour mark. However, if it
takes too long (over 24 hours), make sure to contact Stake.comâs support.
